My PHP Projects

Login form Project: 

Login Form Project Files:
loginform.css,
header.html,
loginform.php,
footer.html

Task: Step 1: To create a login form that 
returns an error message if the user inputs a password
under 5 characters or if the password doesnt have a number. 

Step 2: To save the username and password to an external text
file using fopen, fwrite and fclose. 

Step 3: Use an algorithm to encrpyt the users chosen password, then 
if the users password entered into the form matches the encryprtion algorithm, it saves the users
username, password, the encryption key and a line to confirm the encrypted password matches the entered password
to an external file. 

Challenges: 
I had issues with my if statements because they weren't working
collaborately.

How I solved it:
I realised that for step 1 my sudo code was too complicated so I
restarted the php part of my project. Before I restarted it, I wrote 
a step by step sudo code that was more basic, I then
did it one small step at a time and tested each part before moving to the next step.
This then made it work. I then went on to the next steps which I found easier as I applied what I 
had learnt to the rest of the task. 

Calculator Project:

Calculator Project Files:
calculator.css,
calculator.php

Task: Step 1. To make a calculator that 
returns the sum of two number inputs 
and an operator.
Operators must be add, subtract, multiply and divide.
Step 2. To apply css to style the calculator.

Challenges: 
Understanding how to let the user 
have a choice of all four operators and how
to return the right operator answer for the sum.

How I solved it: 
I did sudo code before getting, this issue, I then
realised that I could use a button for each operator 
I then used an if statement so that if the user pressed
a operator it would then return the correct operation on the sum.

Madlibs Project: 

Madlibs file: 
Madlibs.php 

Task: To make a form that 
allows a user to fill in blanks in the 
sentences. 

Breakthrough: 
Helped me to understand how to use a form to
get input from a user and get php to return it 
to the user so they could see the completed 
sentences.
